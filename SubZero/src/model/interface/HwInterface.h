/**
 * HwInterface is an abstract class responsible for all the I/O interfacing with
 * the hardware. Hardware interface bridges the interaction between a hardware and
 * the software system downstream.
 *
 * From the hardware, the data is polled at the
 * specified sampling rate then decoded into a format (as defined in Data.h) that
 * can be directly used by the rest of the software system. The decoded data is
 * temporary stored in a buffer.
 *
 * This temporary buffer is managed automatically and privately by the interface to
 * ensure that the data stays up-to-date.
 *
 * Commands and data to be sent to the hardware from the software system are first
 * encoded to a format acceptable by the hardware prior to sending.
 *
 * In short the interface is responsible for:
 * 		1. Dealing with the data coming from the hardware: poll->decode
 * 		2. Managing the buffer: store the new stuff, delete the old stuff
 * 		3. Dealing with the data going to the hardware: encode->send
